# Simply.js
A simple library of common front-end modules where styling and animation are done through your own CSS. How often have you gotten a design where the modal/tooltip/etc match the design of some existing third-party library? Designers have their own ideas about what these should look like and how they should animate.

## Features
* No dependencies
* Small footprint
* Style and animation are controlled by your own CSS (examples included)
